# Plan: Architecture Spec Guidance

## Context

Architecture is the highest-weight core artifact (max 18). It's also where AI-generated specs most often fail — restating directory structure, listing imports as "relationships", describing standard patterns the AI already knows. Writers need guidance on what architecture documentation actually helps AI tools vs. what wastes context budget.

The guidance recipe (`specs/guidance-recipe.md`) prescribes 5 steps run as isolated subtasks: load quality principles, research, write, evaluate, final review.

## Why architecture first

- Highest max score of core types (tied with conventions at 18)
- Most common first artifact generated by chat-spec
- Rubric items like `components`, `relationships`, `data_flow` are where code restatement is most tempting
- "Non-obvious" is hardest to interpret for architecture — guidance can calibrate

## Deliverables

| File | What | Size target |
|------|------|-------------|
| `research/architecture-specs.md` | Research findings on architecture documentation for AI | — |
| `guidance/architecture-specs.md` | Distilled writing guide | <2KB |
| `guidance/INDEX.md` | Updated with new entry | +1 row |

## Process (per guidance-recipe.md)

| # | Step | Method |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Load quality principles | Subtask reads `guidance/ai-doc-quality.md`, returns summary |
| 2 | Research best practices | Subtask researches architecture documentation for AI, writes to `research/architecture-specs.md` |
| 3 | Write guidance document | Subtask reads research + quality principles, writes `guidance/architecture-specs.md`, updates INDEX |
| 4 | Evaluate document | Subtask applies self-check from `ai-doc-quality.md`, trims to <2KB |
| 5 | Final review | Orchestrator reads final files, presents to user |

## Also needed

- Fix INDEX.md: currently missing `dev-context.md` entry
- Update `specs/development-history/README.md` with phase 06 row

## Status

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Load quality principles | done |
| 2 | Research | done |
| 3 | Write guidance | done |
| 4 | Evaluate | done — trimmed to 1895 bytes, all 7 checks pass |
| 5 | Final review | done |
| — | Fix INDEX.md | done — added dev-context.md row |
| — | Update dev history README | done |
