# Development History

Each directory is a phase of work, in order.

| # | Phase | Status | Summary |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 01 | Noodling | **done** | 5 idea sketches, 10 decision points, 8 explorations. Concluded: chat-spec is a protocol distributed as a GitHub repo. The README is the landing page, PROTOCOL.md is the product. |
| 02 | Protocol design | **done** | 9 design explorations (DQ0-DQ8): spec-writing principles (research-grounded), session model, state/memory, manifest schema, rubric design, first-run, subsequent-runs, protocol document structure, README structure. |
| 03 | Build | **done** | Synthesized explorations into deliverables: PROTOCOL.md, RUBRICS.md, README.md. Blank-slate tested and dogfooded. |
| 04 | Rubric redesign | **done** | Rubrics had a new-doc bias — measured completeness but couldn't detect problems in existing docs (verbosity, staleness, code restatement). Reframed questions toward value, boosted `current` W:1→W:2, added universal penalty items (`code_restatement` -2, `contradictions` -3). Research-grounded (see `research/ai-doc-quality.md`). |
