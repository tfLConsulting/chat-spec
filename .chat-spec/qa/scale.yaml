  - id: project-size
    question: "How big is the chat-spec project in terms of codebase?"
    difficulty: easy
    answer: "chat-spec is a markdown-only project. There is no source code, no build system, no dependencies. The deliverables are three markdown files at the project root: PROTOCOL.md, RUBRICS.md, and README.md. The rest is research, guidance, development history, and the project's own documentation (which is also the dogfooding test)."
    required_facts:
      - "Markdown-only, no source code"
      - "No build system or dependencies"
      - "Three deliverable files at root"
    red_flags:
      - "It has a src/ directory"
      - "It uses Node.js / Python / any programming language"
      - "It has a test suite"

  - id: deliverables
    question: "What are the deliverables of chat-spec?"
    difficulty: easy
    answer: "Three markdown files at the project root: PROTOCOL.md (the protocol AI tools follow), RUBRICS.md (scoring rubrics for 13 artifact types), and README.md (human landing page). These are the product — everything else in the repo supports their creation and validation."
    required_facts:
      - "PROTOCOL.md — the core protocol"
      - "RUBRICS.md — scoring rubrics"
      - "README.md — human landing page"
      - "They live at the project root"
    red_flags:
      - "The specs/ directory contains deliverables"
      - "There's a CLI or binary deliverable"
      - "The guidance/ directory is a deliverable"

  - id: scope-boundaries
    question: "What does chat-spec NOT do?"
    difficulty: medium
    answer: "chat-spec does not: generate or sync AI config files beyond a 3-line pointer; run as a CLI, MCP server, or standalone tool; require installation, dependencies, or accounts; replace existing documentation (it builds on what exists); do anything automatically (every action requires user approval). It also does not generate code, run tests, or evaluate code quality directly."
    required_facts:
      - "Does not run as a tool or CLI"
      - "Does not require installation"
      - "Does not act without user approval"
      - "Does not replace existing docs"
    red_flags:
      - "It automatically updates documentation"
      - "It can be installed via npm/pip"
      - "It evaluates code quality"

  - id: artifact-types
    question: "How many artifact types does chat-spec support and what are the categories?"
    difficulty: easy
    answer: "13 built-in artifact types: 4 core (architecture, features, conventions, dev-context) and 9 specialised (API docs, data model, deployment, dependencies, design system, security model, performance, integration, AI context config). Users can also define custom artifact types."
    required_facts:
      - "13 built-in types total"
      - "4 core types"
      - "9 specialised types"
      - "Custom types are supported"
    red_flags:
      - "Only 4 artifact types"
      - "Only works with architecture docs"
      - "Cannot be extended"

  - id: external-dependencies
    question: "What external dependencies does chat-spec have?"
    difficulty: easy
    answer: "None. The protocol assumes only: (1) an AI that can read files and write files, and (2) a filesystem. Git is recommended for sharing state across team members and for staleness detection, but not required — staleness detection falls back to file modification times."
    required_facts:
      - "No external dependencies"
      - "Requires only an AI and a filesystem"
      - "Git is recommended but not required"
    red_flags:
      - "Requires a specific AI model"
      - "Requires a database"
      - "Requires an API key or cloud service"

  - id: team-size
    question: "What is the team structure for chat-spec?"
    difficulty: easy
    answer: "Solo maintainer project. No code review or approval process — changes land on main directly."
    required_facts:
      - "Solo maintainer"
      - "No formal review process"
    red_flags:
      - "Large team"
      - "Has contributors or reviewers"
