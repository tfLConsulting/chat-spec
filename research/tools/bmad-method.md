## What it does

Multi-agent SDD framework. Simulates an agile team with specialized AI agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, QA). Each agent handles its phase of the development lifecycle.

## How it works

Agentic agile approach — rather than one AI doing everything, BMAD assigns different roles to different prompts/agents. The Analyst gathers requirements, PM prioritizes, Architect designs, Dev implements, QA validates.

## Relevance to chat-spec

Different problem space — BMAD is about structuring the *development process* with AI agents. Chat-spec is about structuring the *project knowledge* that any process can consume. Could potentially be complementary.
