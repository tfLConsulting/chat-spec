# Mintlify

- **Website:** [mintlify.com](https://www.mintlify.com/)
- **Status:** Active, established company

## What it does

Documentation platform with "Autopilot" — an AI agent that monitors your codebase and proposes documentation updates whenever you ship changes. Reviews changed files, identifies what needs updating, surfaces suggestions, generates PRs. Synthesizes updates from Slack, support tickets, and code.

## Pricing

Autopilot only on Pro plan: **$300/month**

## Strengths

- Automatic monitoring (not manual)
- PR-based workflow
- Multi-source (code + Slack + support)
- Proactive contradiction detection

## Limitations

- Expensive ($300/mo)
- Focused on API/product documentation, not AI coding context
- Not designed for the "help AI assistants understand your project" use case

## Relevance to chat-spec

Mintlify solves "keep human-facing docs current." Chat-spec solves "keep AI-facing context current and high-quality." Similar philosophy (iterative, automated), different audience.
