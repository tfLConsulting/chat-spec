## What it does

CLI-first SDD framework with AI enhancement. Supports 8 AI platforms via 11 universal slash commands (`/sp-pulse`, `/sp-spec`, `/sp-plan`, `/sp-task`, `/sp-execute`, etc.).

## How it works

`pip install specpulse` then `specpulse init my-project --ai claude` creates `.specpulse/` directory. Two-step process: CLI creates foundation (empty spec with metadata), then AI enhances (adds requirements, technical specs, docs).

## Supported platforms

Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Crush, Qwen Code.

## Limitations

- Much smaller community than Spec Kit
- Appears stagnant (no commits since Nov 2025)
- Same fundamental SDD limitations (markdown overhead, agent deviation)
- No independent reviews or critiques found
- Unsubstantiated "10x faster" claims

## Relevance to chat-spec

Mentioned in the original idea as a comparator. SpecPulse is about spec creation workflow, not about evaluating or improving existing project context. The stale repo suggests limited traction.
