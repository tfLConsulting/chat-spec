## What it does

Proposes a standardized `.context/` directory at project root containing:
- `index.md` — project overview and architecture
- `.context.yaml` / `.context.json` — structured metadata
- Nested `.context/` directories per module

Think `.editorconfig` but for AI context.

## Why it's relevant

The directory structure concept is similar to chat-spec's `specs/` directory. CCS proposes a standard for where context lives and how it's structured.

## What it doesn't do

- No quality scoring or maturity tracking
- No iterative improvement
- No evaluation of what's stale or missing
- Stagnant — may be abandoned
