## What it does

Lightweight TypeScript SDD tool. Works with 20+ AI coding tools. Positioned as the simpler alternative to Spec Kit, especially good for brownfield/legacy projects.

## Relevance to chat-spec

Similar to Spec Kit — about writing specs before coding, not about evaluating/improving existing project context. The "good for brownfield" angle is interesting though — chat-spec would also be most valuable for existing projects that need their context improved.
